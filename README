An Octave (Matlab) script to visualise data simultaneously recorded with gps logger (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&hl=en) and activity reminder (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=timo.home.activityMonitor&hl=en) Android apps.

GPSLogger needs to be set to Log to Plain Text, to Keep GPS on between fixes, to keep logging (take off not logging if not moving), and logging interval 1 (1 sample per second).

Once you've logged a session, copy both files from android to a subfolder in ./data folder of your computer for the script to be able to visualise the result. I have included a sample session in the ./data/20161210 where I went for a ~20 min jog. I did 6 15 s sprints along the way (every 45 s and I had a longer recovery prior to the last), which can be seen in the velocity but not in the mean amplitude deviations (MAD [g]). This is because the accelerometer on my phone has only a range of +- 2 gs and thus maxes out at very low jogging velocities.
